This software is free for all to use, like said in the license text.

The original contributor has a very strong wish that you do not try to patent, or otherwise try to limit other peoples use of the software. In this respect I strongly align with `Free Software Foundation <https://www.eff.org/>`_, in their `
Patents – The patent system is broken. <https://www.eff.org/issues/patents>`_ and `Defend Innovation – How to Fix Our Broken Patent System <https://www.eff.org/pages/defend-innovation>`_.
